# Counter Creator Exercise

## Objective

Create a React component that implements a counter with increment and decrement functionality.

## Instructions

1. Create a new file called `Counter.jsx` in the `src` folder.
2. In `Counter.jsx`, create a functional component named `Counter`.
3. Use the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `count` initialized to 0.
4. Implement two functions: `increment` and `decrement` that will increase and decrease the count respectively.
5. Render the current count and two buttons for incrementing and decrementing.
6. Style your component using CSS to make it visually appealing.

## Requirements

- The counter should not go below 0.
- Use proper React conventions and ES6+ syntax.
- Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and follows best practices.

## Bonus

- Add a reset button that sets the counter back to 0.
- Implement a max value that the counter cannot exceed.
- Skip certain numbers
- Change the amount it increments by
